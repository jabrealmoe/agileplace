# Welcome to automation for AgilePlace


This repo represents starter code for a CLI application that can interact with Planview Agileplace using the V2 REST API 
for data analysis on a few boards.

1. Retrieve reporting data in an automated fashion, by downloading existing reports to local drive.
2. Perform analysis on csv data using Pandas & Numpy
3. Consider options for custom visualizations (those that don't already exists in AP)
