# Welcome to Automation for AgilePlace

ðŸŒ€
This repo represents starter code for a CLI application that can interact with Planview Agileplace using the V2 REST API 
for data analysis on a few boards.

1. Retrieve reporting data in an automated fashion, by creating or downloading reports through automation.
2. Perform analysis on csv data using Pandas & Numpy
3. Consider options for custom visualizations (those that don't already exists in AP)
4. Consideration for TabPy integration (to utilize Tableau and Python)
